# Bird-dung Crab Spider
This is a spider that crawls the web. The source code for the spider itself is
located in spid/spiders/mainspider.py, the rest is ssdb code, scrapy
boilerplate and helper scripts.

It's terribly written but it worksâ„¢, so for right now it's enough.

The spider will crawl in breadth-first order, and process the first 200 links
on any page. The spider will ignore links that:
- Have the"nofollow" attribute set
- Are longer than 190 characters
- Link to the same domain
- Contain query strings

Additionally, the spider will not crawl pages that:
- Have urls longer than 190 characters
- Have already been crawled
- Do not contain html
- Contain content that is not in English

# Requirements
- python3
- pyssdb
- ssdb
- scrapy
- pycld2

# Using
- Clone this repo.
- Run `./ssdb_setup.sh` to get the latest ssdb version.
- Run `./start_server.sh` to start the db.
- Wait until "started ssdb server" appears in the terminal.
- In another terminal run `./startcrawl`.
- The spider will begin crawling the web and writing the results to the db.
- To stop the crawl, hit Ctrl-C in the terminal running the spider.
- To stop it faster, hit Ctrl-C again.
- To resume the crawl, run `./startcrawl` again.
- To discard crawl progress, run `./endcrawl`.

# Config
- The `blacklist` file tells the spider which sites not to crawl, separated by newlines.
    - The spider uses dumb substring matching. Putting 'wikipedia.org' will
      prevent the spider from crawling 'wikipedia.org', 'en.wikipedia.org', and
      even 'someotherwebsite.com/wikipedia.org'
- The `topsites` file tells the spider where to start crawling from.
- The rest of the spiders settings can be modified by editing the
  `custom_settings` dictionary in the `spid/spiders/mainspider.py` file.
    - Documentation for Scrapy settings can be found [here](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html)

# Data
Each time the spider crawls a website it will do the following:
1. Add an inverted index entry for each word on the site
2. Add its url to the referrers list for each link on the site
3. Log the number of links on the page to the db
4. Add its url to the db

- The referrers for each website are stored as a zset with keys in the format
  `r:<url>`.
- The inverted index for any word is stored as a zset with keys in the format
  `w:<word>`.
    - The score for each entry corresponds to the occurrences of that word on
      the site.
- The number of links on each website is is stored as an integer value with
  keys in the format `nl:<url>`.
- The PageRanks for each website are stored in the zset `pr` where each key
  member is a url and each score is the corresponding PageRank.
    - The spider will initialize the PageRank of any new page to 0. Calculation
      should happen after the spider has stopped.

# Gotchas
- When parsing a page, only the first 3000 unique words will be processed
- Pages that are not crawled but are linked to other pages will still count
  towards their referrers `nl:` and will also get an `r:` entry.
- The spider will break if the blackist is empty, just blacklist example.com or
something if you don't want a blacklist.

# License
Someone asks me "Why do you use the Affero license?", and jokingly, I reply to
them: "Because I hate you." It is a joke to hide the truth. I cannot tell them
the truth because they won't understand. The truth is "Because I care about
you. I care about all of you."

The Affero license is the bitter medicine, the early bedtime, the plate full of
vegetables you pick at lethargically, in hopes to break your parents will. They
will not break.

They surround you with vaguenesses: "Because it's good for you", "Because you
should", "Because you shouldn't", "Because that's the way it is". 

It isn't until you grow older that you realize why they never gave you a
straight answer. You realize they were protecting you. Protecting you from a
reality you weren't ready for. Because you were too young to understand.
Because you were too young to care. Because you were being annoying. Because
Santa isn't real. Because your goldfish didn't live for 5 years. Because
reality is diabolical. Because innocence is precious. Because they really did
love you, after all.

Most people, when asked "Why do you use Affero?" will offer vague answers full
of words like "freedom", "community" and "open source". Sometimes it is because
they truly belive these things. Often though, like our parents, it is because
they know that you won't understand right now. They know that maybe you won't
ever understand, but they they know it will help you, perhaps long after
they're gone, and perhaps, then, you will thank them.
